#' Palley and Soll (2019)  recruited participants through ClearVoice Research and 
#' Amazon Mechanical Turk to estimate the probability that one team or the other would win 
#' various games in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NCAA Division I Menâ€™s Basketball Tournaments. 
#' The responses for the Round of 64 games and Round of 16 games are treated separately 
#' because the Round of 64 games happen at the start of the tournament and often involve 
#' heavily mismatched teams (e.g., a 1 seed versus a 16 seed) while Round of 16 games typically 
#' involve more evenly matched teams, with implied betting market probabilities closer to 50\%.
