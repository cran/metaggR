\description{
Palley and Soll (2019)  recruited participants through ClearVoice Research and 
Amazon Mechanical Turk to estimate the probability that one team or the other would win 
various games in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NCAA Division I Menâ€™s Basketball Tournaments. 
The responses for the Round of 64 games and Round of 16 games are treated separately 
because the Round of 64 games happen at the start of the tournament and often involve 
heavily mismatched teams (e.g., a 1 seed versus a 16 seed) while Round of 16 games typically 
involve more evenly matched teams, with implied betting market probabilities closer to 50\%.
